This is the repository where I'm condensing my CS50-2023 studies, notes and codes.

There will be several folders. Each folder correspond to a piece of code or program that I wrote, tested and compiled during the course.
I'm not uploading any compiled archives, only the scripts so you can build it in your own machine.
